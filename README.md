# 5 ways me Monster SLayer project is different from Max's

1. I used vuetify for the formatting of my container and rows

2. I used vuetify buttons

3. I replaced the "You won!" and the "You lost!" alert with a modal

4. I added an "Are you sure?" modal when you press give up.

5. I made the logs vuetify chips and changed the colors.
